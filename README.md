## SharpOps

SharpOps is a Docker container built on [`ich777/steamcmd:cs2`](https://github.com/ich777/docker-steamcmd-server/tree/cs2), designed to automate the setup and management of Counter-Strike 2 dedicated servers with CounterStrikeSharp (CSS) and its dependencies. This container simplifies server administration by:

- Automatically installing Metamod & CounterStrikeSharp and keeping them updated
- Managing compatible plugins, ensuring they stay up-to-date
- Handling SteamCMD configuration and CS2 server installation
- Providing a streamlined solution for modded CS2 servers

This project is ideal for server administrators looking for an easy way to deploy and maintain a fully modded CS2 experience with minimal manual intervention. ðŸš€

## Features
 - [x] Metamod auto-install & update
 - [x] CounterStrikeSharp auto-install & update
 - [x] CounterStrikeSharp plugins auto-install & update*
 - [ ] Add compatibility for plugins with multiple assets
 - [ ] Allow users to specify the build/release version of each plugin in `plugins.txt`, rather than always downloading the latest release.
